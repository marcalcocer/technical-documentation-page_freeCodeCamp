            <p>If you do much work on computers, eventually you find that there’s some task you’d like to automate. For example, 
                you may wish to perform a search-and-replace over a large number of text files, or rename and rearrange a bunch of 
                photo files in a complicated way. Perhaps you’d like to write a small custom database, or a specialized GUI application, 
                or a simple game.</p>
            <p>If you’re a professional software developer, you may have to work with several C/C++/Java libraries but find the usual 
                write/compile/test/re-compile cycle is too slow. Perhaps you’re writing a test suite for such a library and find writing 
                the testing code a tedious task. Or maybe you’ve written a program that could use an extension language, and you don’t want 
                to design and implement a whole new language for your application.</p>
            <p>Python is just the language for you.</p>
            <p>You could write a Unix shell script or Windows batch files for some of these tasks, but shell scripts are best at moving around 
                files and changing text data, not well-suited for GUI applications or games. You could write a C/C++/Java program, but it can take 
                a lot of development time to get even a first-draft program. Python is simpler to use, available on Windows, macOS, and Unix operating 
                systems, and will help you get the job done more quickly.</p>
            <p>Python is simple to use, but it is a real programming language, offering much more structure and support for large programs than shell scripts or 
                batch files can offer. On the other hand, Python also offers much more error checking than C, and, being a very-high-level language, it has high-level
                    data types built in, such as flexible arrays and dictionaries. Because of its more general data types Python is applicable to a much larger problem 
                    domain than Awk or even Perl, yet many things are at least as easy in Python as in those languages. </p>
            <p>Python allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused in other Python programs. It comes with a large collection of standard modules that 
                you can use as the basis of your programs — or as examples to start learning to program in Python. Some of these modules provide things like file I/O, system 
                calls, sockets, and even interfaces to graphical user interface toolkits like Tk.</p>
            <p>Python is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time during program development because no compilation and linking is necessary. The interpreter 
                can be used interactively, which makes it easy to experiment with features of the language, to write throw-away programs, or to test functions during bottom-up 
                program development. It is also a handy desk calculator.</p>
            <p>Python enables programs to be written compactly and readably. Programs written in Python are typically much shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, 
                for several reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;</li>
                <li>statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;</li>
                <li>no variable or argument declarations are necessary.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Python is extensible: if you know how to program in C it is easy to add a new built-in function or module to the interpreter, either to perform critical operations 
                at maximum speed, or to link Python programs to libraries that may only be available in binary form (such as a vendor-specific graphics library). Once you are 
                really hooked, you can link the Python interpreter into an application written in C and use it as an extension or command language for that application.</p>
            <p>The rest of the tutorial introduces various features of the Python language and system through examples, beginning with simple expressions, statements and data types,
                    through functions and modules, and finally touching upon advanced concepts like exceptions and user-defined classes.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Numbers,_strings_and_Lists">
            <header><h2>Numbers, strings and Lists</h2></header>
            <p>Let’s try some simple Python commands. Start the interpreter and wait for the primary prompt, <code class="inline">>>>></code>. (It shouldn’t take long.)</p>      

            <h3>Numbers</h3>
            <p>The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an expression at it and it will write the value. Expression syntax is straightforward: 
                the operators <code class="inline">+</code>, <code class="inline">-</code>, <code class="inline">*</code> and <code class="inline">/</code> 
                work just like in most other languages (for example, Pascal or <code class="inline">C</code>); parentheses (<code class="inline">()</code>) can be used for grouping. For example:</p>

            <div class="code">
                <code>
                    >>> 2 + 2 <br>
                    4<br>
                    >>> 50 - 5*6<br>
                    20<br>
                    >>> (50 - 5*6) / 4<br>
                    5.0<br>
                    >>> 8 / 5  # division always returns a floating point number<br>
                    1.6
                </code>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Strings</h3>
            <p>Besides numbers, Python can also manipulate strings, which can be expressed in several ways. They can be enclosed in single quotes (<code class="inline">'...'</code>) or double quotes (<code class="inline">"..."</code>) 
                with the same result. <code class="inline">\</code> can be used to escape quotes:</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>
                        >>> 'spam eggs'  # single quotes<br>
                        'spam eggs'<br>
                        >>> 'doesn\'t'  # use \' to escape the single quote...<br>
                        "doesn't"<br>
                        >>> "doesn't"  # ...or use double quotes instead<br>
                        "doesn't"<br>
                        >>> '"Yes," they said.'<br>
                        '"Yes," they said.'<br>
                        >>> "\"Yes,\" they said."<br>
                        '"Yes," they said.'<br>
                        >>> '"Isn\'t," they said.'<br>
                        '"Isn\'t," they said.'<br>
                    </code>
                </div>

            <h3>Lists</h3>
            <p>Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together other values. The most versatile is the list, which can be written as a list of comma-separated 
                values (items) between square brackets. Lists might contain items of different types, but usually the items all have the same type.</p>

            <div class="code">
                <code>
                    >>> squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25] <br>
                    >>> squares <br>
                    [1, 4, 9, 16, 25] <br>
                </code>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Control_flow_tools">
            <header><h2>Control flow tools</h2></header>      
            <h3>if Statement</h3>
            <p>Perhaps the most well-known statement type is the <code class="inline">if</code> statement. For example:</p>
            <div class="code">
            <code>
                >>> x = int(input("Please enter an integer: ")) <br>
                Please enter an integer: 42 <br>
                >>> if x < 0: <br>
                ...     x = 0 <br>
                ...     print('Negative changed to zero') <br>
                ... elif x == 0: <br>
                ...     print('Zero') <br>
                ... elif x == 1: <br>
                ...     print('Single') <br>
                ... else: <br>
                ...     print('More') <br>            
            </code>        
            </div>

            <p>There can be zero or more <code class="inline">elif</code> parts, and the <code class="inline">else</code> part is 
                optional. The keyword ‘elif’ is short for ‘else if’, and is useful to avoid excessive indentation. 
            An if … elif … elif … sequence is a substitute for the <code class="inline">switch</code> or <code class="inline">case</code> 
            statements found in other languages.</p>

            <h3>for Statement</h3>
            <p>The <code class="inline">for</code> statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used to in C or Pascal. Rather 
                than always iterating over an arithmetic progression of numbers (like in Pascal), or giving the user the ability to define 
                both the iteration step and halting condition (as C), Python’s <code class="inline">for</code> statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a list 
                or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence. For example (no pun intended):</p>      

            <div class="code">
                <code>
                    >>> # Measure some strings: <br>
                    ... words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate'] <br>
                    >>> for w in words: <br>
                    ...     print(w, len(w)) <br>
                    ... brackets
                    cat 3 <br>
                    window 6 <br>
                    defenestrate 12 <br>
                </code>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Data_Structures">
            <header><h2>Data Structures</h2></header>      
            <p>The list data type has some more methods. Here are all of the methods of list objects:</p>     

            <code class="inline">list.append(x)</code>
            <li class="list-code">Add an item to the end of the list. Equivalent to <code class="inline">a[len(a):] = [x]</code>.</li>

            <code class="inline">list.extend(iterable)</code>
            <li class="list-code">Extend the list by appending all the items from the iterable. Equivalent to <code class="inline">a[len(a):] = iterable</code>.</li>

            <code class="inline">list.insert(i, x)</code>
            <li class="list-code">Insert an item at a given position. The first argument is the index of the element before which to insert,
            so <code class="inline">a.insert(0, x)</code> inserts at the front of the list, and <code class="inline">a.insert(len(a), x)</code> is equivalent to 
            <code class="inline">a.append(x)</code>.</li>

            <code class="inline">list.remove(x)</code>
            <li class="list-code">Remove the first item from the list whose value is equal to x. It raises a <code class="inline">ValueError</code> if there is no such item.</li>

            <code class="inline">list.pop([i])</code>
            <li class="list-code">Remove the item at the given position in the list, and return it. If no index is specified, <code class="inline">a.pop()</code> removes and returns 
            the last item in the list. (The square brackets around the i in the method signature denote that the parameter is optional, not that you should
                type square brackets at that position. You will see this notation frequently in the Python Library Reference.)</li>

            <code class="inline">list.clear()</code>
            <li class="list-code">Remove all items from the list. Equivalent to <code class="inline">del a[:]</code>.</li>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Modules">
            <header><h2>Modules</h2></header>      
            <p>If you quit from the Python interpreter and enter it again, the definitions you have made (functions and variables) are lost. Therefore, if you want 
                to write a somewhat longer program, you are better off using a text editor to prepare the input for the interpreter and running it with that file as
                    input instead. This is known as creating a script. As your program gets longer, you may want to split it into several files for easier maintenance. 
                    You may also want to use a handy function that you’ve written in several programs without copying its definition into each program.</p>      

            <p>To support this, Python has a way to put definitions in a file and use them in a script or in an interactive instance of the interpreter. Such a file
                    is called a module; definitions from a module can be imported into other modules or into the main module (the collection of variables that you have 
                    access to in a script executed at the top level and in calculator mode).</p>
